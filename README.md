# TripTogether

The basic functionality of the app would be similar to that of Uber or other ride-hailing services. Users would be able to request a ride through the app and be matched with a nearby driver. The driver would pick up the user and transport them to their destination, just like a regular taxi service.

However, the twist in this app would be that users would be able to connect their Spotify accounts to the app. Once connected, the app would analyze the music preferences of all passengers in the car and create a custom playlist that blends together all of their favorite songs.
